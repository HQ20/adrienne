Let me introduce you to [Adrienne](http://www.techhq.io/adrienne), a mobility services protocol conceived to disrupt an industry worth 2 trillion dollars and with a target market of a billion users.

The 24h hours of frenzied thinking and coding at the [Mercedes-Benz Hackathon](https://mobilityhacklisbon.io/) was the catalyst for the [TechHQ](http://www.techhq.io) team to come up with an idea and a [prototype](http://github.com/hq20/adrienne) for a protocol that can implement today a mobility services paradigm which was thought to be still ten years away. 

The experience of the [TechHQ](http://www.techhq.io) team in quick development of blockchain solutions, combined with our knowledge of the automotive industry was the base upon which this idea and prototype were built.

The decentralization properties of blockchain technology allow the [Adrienne Protocol](http://www.techhq.io/adrienne) to break through the scale limitations of current mobility services solutions. We are building the future today.
