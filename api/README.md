# api
This is the api folder.

### Requirements
* node 8.12+
* npm 6.4+ or yarn 1.2+

We recomend yarn as it's faster, securer and works offline. And obviously because we provide a *yarn.lock* file.

## Folder structure

* init
    * code that should be runned before start using the app
* src
    * the api code

## Development
It's not needed to run ethereum before api.
```
$ yarn
$ npm run init
$ npm run start
# or, for hot reload use - npm run dev
```
